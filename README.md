👋 Heyyy, I'm Salimatah 

🌱 I’m currently a student at University studying Electronics and Computer engineering.

💼 I have done some data scientist work, primarily based in the UK, in the Energy Industry(Green).

👀 I’m interested in delving into the fascinating realm where data science intersects with the domains of environmental sustainability and user experience enhancement. I'm curious about leveraging data-driven insights and techniques to address environmental challenges, promote sustainability practices, while simultaneously seeking ways to enhance user experiences through personalized approaches and seamless interactions.
